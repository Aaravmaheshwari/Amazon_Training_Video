## Overview

This is the code for [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkzED9HvMG0) video on Youtube by Siraj Raval on Amazon Web Services, using SageMaker. 

## Description

The goal of this project was to solve the problem of a telecom operator losing customers to its competitor.
A predictive model was built with classification algorithms to predict the likelihood of churn (leaving a service) of a mobile telephone user. 

Random Forest classifier, XGBoost & Decision Tree algorithms were used for training & testing the model while feature engineering was extensively carried out to fine-tune and improve the accuracy of the model.

More work was done in cleaning the data â€“ handling missing values and inconsistency in the data. This project was submitted in a Kaggle Competition.

## Usage
